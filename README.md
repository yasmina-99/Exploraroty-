# Exploratory Data Analysis using 
# About Dataset
This dataset contains information on car accidents that occurred in the contiguous United States from February 2016 to December 2021. The data was collected from multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident data from a variety of sources, including transportation departments, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors.

Currently, the dataset includes approximately *2.8 million accident records*. This dataset can be used for a wide range of applications, including real-time accident prediction, studying accident hotspots, casualty analysis, and extracting cause-and-effect rules to predict car accidents. The most recent release of the dataset can also be used to study the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents.
